                    p
                        | We use the Spotify API to design this music recommender system that provides you with suggestions of songs based on your interests. The system allows you to interact with the recommender system to explore good songs.
                    p
                        | In this study, we aim to get your perceived quality of recommended songs and measure your cognitive load while interacting with our system.

                        | Your Task
                    p
                        | First, select a scenario for the playlist you want to create. Then please watch a video tutorial for the system. Before starting user study, you need to fill a pre-study questionnaire. The questionnaire contains a memory test which requires flash player enabled.
                    p
                        | After login, you will see a recommended playlist containing 20 songs based on your listening history. After playing with our system over 10 minutes, you have to listen and rate all recommended songs and then answer a post-study questionnaire. Participating in this study will take about 20 - 30 minutes.

                    p(style="color:white")
                        | Please ensure you have spent 10 minutes on playing the system. A questionnaire link only will be activated at the right top corner when all songs have been listened and rated.

                    p(style="color:red")
                        | Please note: when you tweak the system, the recommendations will be updated and previous ratings will be lost. So please rate songs only when you are done with tweaking system.
